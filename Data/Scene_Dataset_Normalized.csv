Anyone or anything that tries to hurt them gets burned away to nothing... melted... like so many candles. Seeing a dragon would make me very happy. Well, after 15 years in a pleasure house, I imagine just seeing the sky makes you happy. I was not locked in. I have seen things. What have you seen? I have seen... A man from Asshai with a dagger of real dragonglass. I have seen a man who could change his face the way that other men change their clothes. And I have seen a pirate who wore his weight in gold and whose ship had sails of colored silk. So... Have you seen one? A pirate ship? A dragon. No, the last one died many years before I was born. I will tell you what I have seen their skulls. They used to decorate the throne room in the Red Keep. When I was very young, just 3 or 4, my father used to walk me down the rows and I would recite their names for him. When I got them all right, he would give me a sweet. The ones closest to the door were the last ones they were able to hatch and they were all stunted and wrong. Skulls no bigger than dog skulls. But as you got closer to the Iron Throne... They got bigger and bigger and bigger. There was Ghiscar and Valryon, Vermithrax, Essovius, Archonel, Meraxes, Vhagar... And Balerion the Dread... whose fire forged the Seven Kingdoms into one. What happened to the skulls? I do not know. The Usurper had them smashed to powder, I expect. Scattered to the wind. That very sad. Yes, it is. What did I buy you for? To make me sad? No, your Grace. To teach your sister. To teach my sister how to be a better lover? You think I bought you to make Khal Drogo happy? You pretty little idiot. Go on then.

I thought if I did not talk about her, she would just fade away for you. When I realized that was not going to happen, I refused to ask out of spite. I did not want to give you the satisfaction of thinking I cared enough to ask.

What harm could Lyanna Stark ghost do to either of us that we have not done to each other a hundred times over? You want to know the horrible truth? I ca not even remember what she looked like.

Is this how justice is done in the Vale? you accuse me of crimes, I deny them, so you throw me in a cell to freeze and starve? Where is the King Justice? I am accused and demand a trial. If you are tried and found guilty, then by the king own laws you will pay with your life. I understand the law. We have no executioner in the Eyrie. Life is more elegant here. Open the Moon Door. You want a trial, my Lord Lannister. Very well. My son will listen to whatever you have to say, and you will hear his judgement. Then you will leave, by one door or the other. No need to bother Lord Robin. I demand a trial by combat. You have that right. My lady, I beg the honor. Let me be your champion. The honor should be mine. For the love I bore your lord husband let me avenge his death. I will fight for you, my Lady. It will be my honor. The honor should be mine. Make the bad man fly! Ser Vardis... You are quiet. Did you want to avenge my husband? With all my heart, my Lady. But the Imp is half my size. It would be shameful to slaughter such a man and call it justice. Agreed. You demanded a trial by combat. Now I demand a champion. I have that right, same as you. My Lady, I would gladly fight the Imp champion for you. I would not be too glad, ser. I name my brother, Jaime Lannister.

She ran out onto the road, clothes half torn off, with two men on her heels. Jaime scared away the men easily enough, while l wrapped her in my cloak. She was too scared to send off on her own, so while Jaime hunted down the rapers l took her to the nearest inn and fed her. Her name was Tysha. She was a wheelwright orphan. And she was hungry. Together we finished off three chickens and a flagon of wine. lmpossible as it seems, there was a time when l was unaccustomed to wine. l forgot how afraid l was around girls. how l was always waiting for them to laugh at me or look away embarrassed, or ask me about my tall, handsome brother. l forgot about everything but Tysha. And somehow l found myself in her bed. For three chickens, l should hope so. lt did not last long. l did not know what the hell l was doing. But she was good to me. She kissed me afterwards and sang me a song. And by morning l was deep enough in love to ask for her hand. A few lies, a few gold coins, one drunken septon and there you have it - man and wife. For a fortnight anyway, until the septon sobered up and told my father. Well, l imagine that was the end of all that. Not quite. First, my father had Jaime tell me the truth. The girl was a whore, you see. Jaime had arranged the whole thing - the road, the rapers, all of it. He thought it was time l had a woman. After my brother confessed, my father brought in my wife and gave her to his guards. He paid her well - a silver for each man. How many whores command that kind of price? He brought me into the barracks and made me watch. By the end, she had so much silver that the coins were slipping through her fingers and rolling on to the floor. l would have killed the man who did that to me. You should have known she was a whore.

If you heard a Dothraki horde was approaching your city, you might do the same, Khaleesi. Horde? My name is Daenerys Daenerys Stormborn of the house Targaryen. You know me, my lord? Only by reputation, Khaleesi. And I am no lord, merely a humble merchant. They call you the Mother of Dragons. And what should I call you? Oh, my name is quite long and quite impossible for foreigners to pronounce. I am simply a trader of spices. But we are the Thirteen, charged with the governance and protection of Qarth, the greatest city that ever was or will be. The beauty of Quarth is legendary Qarth. Might we see the dragons? My friend, we have traveled very far. We have no food, no water. Once I see my people fed, I would be honored Forgive me, Mother of Dragons, but no man alive has seen a living dragon. Some of my more skeptical friends refuse to believe your children even exist. All we ask is the chance to see for ourselves. I am not a liar. Oh, I do not think you are. But as I have never met you before, my opinion on the matter is of limited value. Where I come from, guests are treated with respect, not insulted at the gates. Then perhaps you should return to where you come from. We wish you well. What are you doing? You promised to receive me. We have received you. Here we are, and here you are. If you do not let us in, all of us will die. Which we shall deeply regret. But Qarth did not become the greatest city that ever was or will be by letting Dothraki savages through its gates. Khaleesi, please be careful. Thirteen! When my dragons are grown, we will take back what was stolen from me and destroy those who have wronged me. We will lay waste to armies and burn cities to the ground. Turn us away and we will burn you first. Ah. You are a true Targaryen. Only, as you said a moment ago, if we do not let you into the city, you will all die. And so Retreating in fear from a little girl is unbecoming of the greatest city that ever was or will be. The discussion is over, Xaro Xhoan Daxos. The Thirteen have spoken. I am one of the Thirteen, and I am still speaking. The girl threatens to burn our city to the ground and you would invite her in for a cup of wine? She is the Mother of Dragons. Do you expect her to watch her people starve without breathing fire? I believe we can allow a few Dothraki through our gates without dooming our city. After all, here I am, a savage from the Summer Isles, and Qarth still stands. Our decision is final. Very well.

Every child in Volantis was in the Rhoyne that day. The rich, the poor, we were all there. Naked, screaming, racing to the little islands. Drummers were playing for coppers on the east bank. I was treading water, talking to a friend, when I realized I had not seen my brother. I called his name. Then I started screaming his name. And then I saw him floating face down. My heart just stopped. I was I dragged him from the water. My friend helped me, I think. I do not even remember. He was so little. Then we pulled him onto the riverbank.

So you know what they are without having to talk to them. And this man worked on a fishing boat. And he pushed me out of the way. You have to understand, for a slave to push a highborn girl, that death for the man, a terrible death. But he pushed me out of the way, and he started pressing on my brother chest again and again and again, until my brother spat out half of the Rhoyne and cried out. And the man cradled his head and told him to be calm. I decided two things that day. I would not waste my years planning dances and masquerades with the other noble ladies. And when I came of age, I would never live in a slave city again. I am sorry, Your Grace. You told me of your problems and I have blathered on.
